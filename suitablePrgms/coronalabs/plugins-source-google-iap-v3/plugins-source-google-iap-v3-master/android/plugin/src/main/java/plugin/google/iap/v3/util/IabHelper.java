/**
 * Provides convenience methods for in-app billing. You can create one instance of this
 * class for your application and use it to process in-app billing operations.
 * It provides synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) methods for
 * many common in-app billing operations, as well as automatic signature
 * verification.
 *
 * After instantiating, you must perform setup in order to start using the object.
 * To perform setup, call the {@link #startSetup} method and provide a listener;
 * that listener will be notified when setup is complete, after which (and not before)
 * you may call other methods.
 *
 * After setup is complete, you will typically want to request an inventory of owned
 * items and subscriptions. See {@link #queryInventory}, {@link #queryInventoryAsync}
 * and related methods.
 *
 * When you are done with this object, don't forget to call {@link #dispose}
 * to ensure proper cleanup. This object holds a binding to the in-app billing
 * service, which will leak unless you dispose of it correctly. If you created
 * the object on an Activity's onCreate method, then the recommended
 * place to dispose of it is the Activity's onDestroy method.
 *
 * A note about threading: When using this object from a background thread, you may
 * call the blocking versions of methods; when using from a UI thread, call
 * only the asynchronous versions and handle the results via callbacks.
 * Also, notice that you can only call one asynchronous operation at a time;
 * attempting to start a second asynchronous operation while the first one
 * has not yet completed will result in an exception being thrown.
